## 1. Executive Summary & Problem

Students in India frequently make life-defining career, stream, examination, and skill decisions without access to trustworthy, practical mentorship. Generic internet advice is:
- **Scattered & Unstructured:** Fragmented across YouTube, Reddit, and forums.
- **Unreliable & Commercialized:** Influencer claims without institutional verification.
- **Difficult to Personalize:** Lacks context regarding student tier, branch, and semester timeline.

**Mentor Connect AI** bridges this gap by connecting students directly with verified college seniors and alumni from premier institutions (IITs, DTU, NSUT, DU) through:
1. **Explainable Deterministic Matching:** Transparent multi-factor compatibility scoring (0-100%).
2. **AI-Assisted Career Counselor (MentorAI):** Diagnoses student dilemmas and formulates strategic next steps with Gemini 3.8 Flash.
3. **Peer-to-Peer WebRTC Video:** End-to-end encrypted consultations with camera/mic controls and screen sharing.
4. **Interactive Milestones & Career Roadmap:** Dynamic readiness percentage calculated directly from completed tasks.
5. **Multi-Stage Institutional Verification:** AI OCR extraction + institutional email verification + administrative oversight.

## 3. Core Technical Features

### 3.1 Explainable Mentor Matching Engine
Matches are calculated mathematically across 7 weighted dimensions:
$$\text{Score} = (\text{Career Alignment} \times 0.30) + (\text{Skill Overlap} \times 0.20) + (\text{Company/Exam} \times 0.15) + (\text{Experience} \times 0.15) + (\text{Availability} \times 0.10) + (\text{College Affinity} \times 0.05) + (\text{Language} \times 0.05)$$

Every recommendation displays **transparent reasons** (e.g., *"Direct career alignment: SDE-2 at Microsoft"*, *"Same college background: DU / DTU"*).

### 3.2 Anti-Double-Booking Architecture
Strict server-side validation guarantees that two students cannot book the same time slot simultaneously:
- Queries active reservations (`ACCEPTED` or `REQUESTED`) on the mentor's schedule.
- Returns transactional conflict status: `409 Conflict: Slot already reserved.`

### 3.3 Real WebRTC Video Sessions with Screen Sharing
- **Signaling:** Socket.IO handles room discovery, `offer`, `answer`, and `ice-candidate` handshakes.
- **Media Stream:** True peer-to-peer browser-to-browser media exchange.
- **Screen Sharing:** Dynamic video track replacement via `getDisplayMedia()`.
- **Fault-Tolerant Fallback:** Automatic audio/chat fallback if video device access is denied.

### 3.4 Trust & Mentor Verification Pipeline
- Mentors submit institutional email (`@du.ac.in`, `@dtu.ac.in`), student/alumni ID, graduation year, and degree document.
- AI OCR extracts candidate name, college, and enrollment ID, calculating a confidence score (e.g., 96%).
- Administrator reviews documents and approves credentials to grant the official `✓ VERIFIED MENTOR` badge.

## 6. Jury Technical Questions & Answers

### Q: Why use AI instead of a simple database search?
**A:** AI does not replace deterministic matching; it augments it. We use Gemini 3.8 Flash for qualitative career diagnosis, formulating high-impact interview questions, and document OCR verification. The compatibility score itself is 100% deterministic and explainable.

### Q: Why not just use LinkedIn?
**A:** LinkedIn suffers from high noise, unsolicited cold messages with <5% response rates, unverified credentials, and no built-in structured roadmap tracking or video consultation framework.

### Q: How do you prevent double bookings?
**A:** Concurrency-checked database transactions check slot overlaps across date, time, and mentor ID before committing the booking.

### Q: What happens if the Gemini AI API experiences a network outage?
**A:** We implemented a resilient algorithmic fallback engine in `aiService.ts` that immediately serves deterministic guidance based on domain rules, guaranteeing zero failure during live evaluation.

## 8. What's New in v2 (bug fixes & upgrades)

**Video call**
- Fixed "call never connects": ICE candidates arriving early are now queued, both sides always negotiate audio+video (so a user with no camera still sees the other), and reconnect / rejoin / ICE-restart are handled.
- **Incoming-call popup** with Accept / Decline (previously the other person was never notified).
- **TURN relay** support (`/api/ice-servers`, `TURN_*` env vars) so calls work across different networks.
- Clear on-screen messages: camera busy / permission denied / page not on HTTPS / peer left / call declined.
- Fixed the avatar overlay that covered the remote video, in-call chat that the other person never received, and fake hard-coded action items (now saved to the student's roadmap).
- Remote mute / camera-off / screen-share indicators; screen share works even if you have no camera.

**1-to-1 chat**
- "Message Mentor" button on mentor cards/profile, "Message" on Sessions and Mentor Hub; mentors can start chats with students too.
- Fixed duplicate messages (REST + socket both saved) and ID collisions; messages are saved once and pushed live to both people.
- Typing indicator, online status, unread badges, sent/failed/retry states, "Video Call" button inside chat.
- Chats are private: only the two participants can read or send.

**Security & reliability**
- Login tokens are now HMAC-signed (earlier a raw user id was the token, so anyone could impersonate anyone); sockets are authenticated too.
- Only the owning mentor can accept/reject a booking.
- Per-tab sessions (`sessionStorage`) so Student and Mentor tabs no longer overwrite each other.
- Fixed `npm install` failing (esbuild/vite peer conflict), first-load 401 race and empty Mentor dashboard after role switch.
- Gemini model id configurable via `GEMINI_MODEL`.

**Demo tip:** open two tabs (Student + Mentor). For a second device use an https link (ngrok / cloudflared) because browsers block camera on plain `http://<ip>`.
